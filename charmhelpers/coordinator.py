The coordinator module allows you to use Juju's leadership feature to
coordinate operations between units of a service.

:author: Stuart Bishop <stuart.bishop@canonical.com>


Services Framework Usage
========================

Ensure a peer relation is defined in metadata.yaml. Instantiate a
BaseCoordinator before invoking ServiceManager.manage().

For example::

    from charmhelpers.core import services
    from charmhelpers import coordinator

    serial = coordinator.Serial()

    def maybe_restart(servicename):
        # Lazy evaluation means the restart permission request
        # will only be made if necessary, avoiding hook storms.
        if needs_restart() and serial.aquire('restart'):
            hookenv.service_restart(servicename)

    services = [dict(service='servicename',
                     data_ready=[maybe_restart])]

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        manager = services.ServiceManager(services)
        manager.manage()



Traditional Usage
=================

Ensure a peer relationis defined in metadata.yaml.

If you are using charmhelpers.core.hookenv.Hooks, ensure that a
BaseCoordinator is instantiated before calling Hooks.execute.

If you are not using charmhelpers.core.hookenv.Hooks, ensure
that a BaseCoordinator is instantiated and its handle() method
invoked at the start of your leader-elected, leader-settings-changed
and peer relation-changed hooks.

For example::

    from charmhelpers.core import hookenv

    hooks = hookenv.Hooks()

    def maybe_restart():
        serial = coordinator.Serial()
        if serial.granted('restart'):
            hookenv.service_restart('myservice')

    @hooks.hook
    def config_changed():
        update_config()
        serial = coordinator.Serial()
        # Lazy evaluation means the restart permission request
        # will only be made if necessary, avoiding hook storms.
        if needs_restart() and serial.aquire('restart'):
            maybe_restart()

    @hooks.hook
    def cluster_relation_changed():
        serial = coordinator.Serial()
        serial.handle() # MUST ALWAYS be called from peer relation-changed
        maybe_restart()

    @hooks.hook
    def leader_settings_changed():
        serial = coordinator.Serial()
        serial.handle() # MUST ALWAYS be called from leader_settings_changed
        maybe_restart()

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        hooks.execute()


API
===

A simple API is provided similar to traditional locking APIs. A
permission may be requested using the aquire() method, and the
granted() method may be used do to check if a permission previously
aquired has been granted. It doesn't matter how many times aquire()
is called in a hook.

Permissions are released at the end of the hook if the requests
could be aquired immediately. All granted permissions are released
by the leader-settings-changed hook.

Whenever a charm needs to perform a coordinated action it will aquire()
the permission and perform the action immediately if aquisition is
successful. It will also need to perform the same action in both the
leader-settings-changed hook and peer relation-changed hooks if the
permission has been granted.


Grubby Details
--------------

Why do you need to be able to perform the same action in three places?
If the unit is the leader, then it may be able to grant its own lock
and perform the action immediately in the source hook. If the unit is
not the leader, then the leader will not be aware of the request until
after the source hook as completed and the lock will never be granted
immediately, so the only opportunity the unit has has to perform the
action is in the leader-settings-changed hook. If the unit is the leader
and cannot grant its own lock, then the only opportunity for it to
perform the action is when a peer releases a lock, which triggers the
peer relation-changed on all units including the leader. This would be
simpler if leader-settings-changed was invoked on the leader, but that
not the case with Juju 1.23 leadership. I chose not to implement a
callback model, where a callback was passed to aquire() to be executed
as soon as the lock is granted, because the callback may become invalid
between making the request and being granted the lock due to a
'juju upgrade-charm' being run in the interim.
